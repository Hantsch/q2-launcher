# Roadmap

## Step 1 — the shell (done)

- Frameless window with custom chrome, persisted geometry, single-instance lock
- Typed IPC contract with a preload allowlist and startup completeness check
- Atomic, self-healing `state.json` with a migration framework
- Installation management: add existing, search this PC (Steam/GOG/Epic/classic
  paths + optional deep scan), create new, rename, reorder, favourite, relocate,
  remove
- Validation with an actionable fix behind every failed check
- Engine detection for r1q2, Q2PRO, Yamagi, KMQuake II, vkQuake2, Q2RTX, the
  original client and the 2023 remaster
- Launch: pure, unit-tested command-line builder; process tracking; play time
- Module seam proven end to end by the `library` module
- Job registry and the action-bar download readout the install module will drive
- Design system, i18n scaffolding, generated app icon

### Explicit non-goals for step 1

- No downloading, patching or verifying of game files
- No deleting anything from disk — `installations:remove` rejects
  `deleteFromDisk: true` outright
- No auto-update of the launcher itself
- No server browser, no news feed (the hero carousel dots are a placeholder)
- No mod or asset-pack handling

## Modules

Each has a manifest, a route and a page in the app already; none has a
main-process half yet. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#adding-a-module` has the checklist.

### Install — download, update, repair

Where the action bar's progress readout finally gets real data.

- Needs: a job queue, resumable HTTP downloads with progress, archive extraction,
  hashing for verification.
- Validation should become **size-first, hash-later**: `RETAIL_PAK_SIZES` in
  `src/shared/constants.ts` already distinguishes the retail paks from the
  shareware demo without hashing 180 MB. Real hashes belong to this module.
- Because r1q2 writes into its own install tree, this module must refuse to create
  installations under `Program Files` (or warn loudly). The `write-access` check
  already flags it.

### Config — r1q2 settings and cvars

Scope, data model and story cut now live in
[docs/concepts/config-module.md](concepts/config-module.md) — folding the discontinued
`q2-config-manager` in as this module, redesigned in the launcher's own design system.
Status: `docs/sprints/S01` planned — profile CRUD, installation assignment, cvar editor, write
pipeline, import (stories 001–005). Keyboard/overview, alt layers, advanced tab, validator,
cleanup and the in-session profile-switch bind are the concept's remaining scope, planned for a
follow-up sprint once S01 is built and accepted. The engine findings below stay as factual
background for that concept.

The findings that shape this module, from reading the r1q2 source:

- **There is no `r1q2.cfg`.** The files are `default.cfg` (inside `pak0`),
  `config.cfg` (engine-written, archived cvars and key bindings), `autoexec.cfg`
  (user) and `postinit.cfg` — an r1q2 addition that runs after video/sound/input
  init, which is the right place for anything needing the renderer up.
- **Config is per-game-directory.** `config.cfg` is written to
  `<install>/<gamedir>/`, so the base game and each mod have their own.
- **r1q2 has no user directory at all** — no `homedir` cvar, no `-portable`, no
  Documents redirection. Q2PRO and Yamagi do; that difference is already modelled
  as `writeDirStrategy` on `EngineDefinition`.
- `cddir` was removed from r1q2, so read-only-source + writable-target layouts are
  not achievable that way.
- Editing must back up the user's existing `.cfg` before writing, and the module
  should diff rather than rewrite.

### Mods — game directories

- `+set game <dir>` is already built and validated (single ASCII token). The rest
  is discovery, install, enable/disable and per-mod config.
- Needs `game-lifecycle` so it knows not to mutate files while the game is running.

### Assets — texture, model and sound packs

- Needs conflict detection between packs that touch the same files, plus a record
  of what a pack changed so it can be removed again. `Installation.moduleData` is
  the per-installation slot for that.

## Follow-ups worth doing

**Verify while implementing.** These were researched but not confirmed on a real
machine, and each is a one-line fix in a data table:

- `-nopathcheck` is passed to r1q2 by default (`EngineDefinition.defaultArgs`).
  r1q2's only dash arguments are `-nopathcheck`, `-nocwdcheck`, `-hideconsole` and
  `-oldconsole` — notably there is **no `-safe`**, so a safe mode has to be a
  launcher-composed bundle of `+set` overrides.
- Executable and marker names for engines other than r1q2/Q2PRO
  (`ENGINE_DEFINITIONS` in `src/shared/types/engine.ts`), especially the 2023
  remaster's exe names.
- `detectedVersion` is never populated. Reading the Windows version resource from
  the exe, or parsing the r1q2 console banner, would fill it.

**Hardening:**

- Serve the production renderer from a privileged `app://` scheme instead of
  `file://` (Electron security checklist item 18).
- Make the zod schema a **required** parameter of the typed `handle()` wrapper, so
  validation cannot be forgotten on a new channel.
- Auto-update via `electron-updater`, and a decision on code signing — unsigned
  builds give users a SmartScreen warning.

**Tooling:**

- ESLint is deliberately absent. `typescript-eslint@8` caps TypeScript at
  `<6.1.0`, and this project is on TypeScript 7, so the two cannot be installed
  together. Revisit when typescript-eslint supports TS 7; `tsc -b` plus Prettier
  covers the gap until then.
- Vite is pinned to 7.x: `electron-vite@5` peers `vite ^5||^6||^7`, and
  `@vitejs/plugin-react@6` peers `vite ^8` exclusively. Revisit when
  `electron-vite@6` is stable.
- A committed Playwright driver for the app would make UI changes verifiable. One
  gotcha to carry over: this repo is often developed from inside an Electron host
  that exports `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`; inherited, it makes `electron.exe` run as
  plain Node and the main process dies on its first `require('electron')`. Delete
  the variable from the child environment before launching.

**UX:**

- Per-installation launch profiles (arbitrary cvar overrides, safe mode, connect
  to a server) — the launch layer is already a plan builder, so this is additive.
- Crash detection: a non-zero exit shortly after start is worth surfacing.
- The news carousel in the hero is wired but empty.
- Only `en` ships. Adding a locale is a JSON file plus one entry in
  `src/renderer/src/i18n/index.ts`.
