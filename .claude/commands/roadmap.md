Run the roadmap ritual: **$1** (no argument: run `check` first, then offer `plan`).

## Project profile

Read `.claude/ai-scrum.md` first — `roadmap-path`, `requirements-path`, `sprints-path`,
`concepts-path`, `systems-path`, id formats and `doc-language` come from there. If it is
missing, stop and say: run `/ai-scrum:setup` (ai-scrum plugin) first.

## Role

The roadmap is THE one source of status and planning (milestone granularity). This command
keeps it honest and turns it into the next sprints. Story truth stays in `requirements-path`
— the roadmap never duplicates story status.

## Mode `check` — sync & drift

1. Read the roadmap.
2. Establish the real state cheaply (Glob/Grep + targeted reads, do not read everything):
   - `<requirements>/*.md` — open stories and their status; the last entry in
     `<requirements>/done/INDEX.md`.
   - `<sprints>/` — open sprints (`sprint.md` outside `done/`) and the most recent review
     under `done/`.
   - `<concepts>/` — are there concepts without a line in the roadmap? Are there concepts
     whose stories are all done (→ they belong in `<systems>/`)?
3. Correct every deviation directly in the roadmap. Exception: **"accepted" on a milestone is
   marked by the user only** — name missing live acceptances as an open point, do not tick
   them yourself.
4. Report compactly: drift corrected, state of the current phase, what is waiting
   unprioritised.

## Mode `plan` — cut the next sprint (together with the user)

1. Precondition: `check` has run in this session (otherwise run `check` first).
2. Propose what comes next — default: the next open milestone of the current phase; name
   alternatives from "Open / unprioritised". Real direction decisions (which milestone,
   scope boundaries, deliberate omissions) via `AskUserQuestion` with a recommendation — no
   silent priority assumptions.
3. Cut the chosen milestone (or its first part) into stories:
   - Derive scope from the concept linked in the roadmap + its "Gaps/notes".
   - Cut small: one sprint = one playable/verifiable increment, 3–6 stories as a guideline.
   - One file per story from `<requirements>/_TEMPLATE.md` (`status: draft`, next free id per
     the profile's `story-id-format`, determined from `done/INDEX.md` + the open stories):
     requirement + acceptance criteria from the user's perspective; deliberately open
     decisions as concrete questions in `## Open Questions` (resolved by
     `/sprint` in its clarification round). **No** plan/deliverables — that is
     refine's job.
4. Create `<sprints>/<next free sprint id>/sprint.md` from the template: goal, stories in
   build order, `status: planned`, `milestone:` line.
5. Record the sprint under its milestone in the roadmap (status stays open until built and
   accepted).
6. Show the user the cut (sprint goal + one sentence per story) for correction. Then the user
   starts `/sprint <id>` themselves.

## Rules

- Do not commit, do not push. No implementation, no refine — only the roadmap, story drafts
  and `sprint.md`.
- Keep milestone granularity: never copy story status lists into the roadmap.
- Concepts stay timeless (what/why) — when/status lives only in the roadmap.
- Move fully implemented concepts to `<systems>/` (`git mv`, update the status line) — that
  is part of `check`.
- Write generated artifacts in the profile's `doc-language`; keep the existing language of
  files you are only editing.
